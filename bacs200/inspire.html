    <p>
        Zendaya is my hero. She is a very talented young woman who continues to inspire many girls and women around the world. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some of the reasons why Zendaya is my hero: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>She strives to be a positive role model everyday, especially for little kids.</li>
        <li>She speaks out about sexism, racism and inequalit.y</li>
        <li>She motivates women and girls to speak up for themselves and decrease injustice against women/girls.</li>
        <li>She has stated that she would rather be remembered for being a good human being than being a great artist/actor.</li>
        <li>She constantly reminds girls/women that we are all beautiful and need to be more positive about ourselves and others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It is no secret that I am a big fan of women/girls who promote body positivity, self love
        and  equality. Zendaya speaks out and fights for all 3 of those issues. She not only is a 
        great artist/actor, but she is a great woman. She is the type of young woman I strive to be myself every day. 
        I hope that all of the young girls and women out there take some advice from her.
